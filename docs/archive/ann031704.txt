Dear Friends,

I'm happy to announce the new update of 
DBISAM Extensions Suite (v. 1.22). 

Changes from the previous version:
- Bugs fixed in Schema Editor.

DBISAM Extensions support DBISAM v3.17 
and later and is also compatible with v4.x.

The most important features are:
 - Build-in database schema ***diagramming tool*** 
  (accessible from Delphi IDE) 
 - Database version control, including incremental
   updates (SQL Script).
 - Database manipulations (export/import to disk file) 
 - Macroses in SQL
 - Referential integrity constraints
 - Triggers (SQL Script)
 - Replications 
 - Centralized Events & Errors handling 
 - Automatic Pascal declarations for tables defined 
   in the database schema and much more. 

The package also includes component & diagram editor 
help files and demos, explaining most of its functionality.

Fully functional trial version (with part of source 
code included) is available at:

You can order the source code for only $49.00 at:
