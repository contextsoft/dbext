ANN: Context Database Extensions v.2.02 beta is now available!

Dear Friend,

We're happy to announce that the second beta version of Context
Database Extension v.2 has been realeased and is available for
download at:

  http://www.contextsoft.com/products/ctxdbext/downloads.jsp. 

Please, make sure to also download and install Context
Database Designer 2.02, which is listed as a separate download.

Context Database Designer is used as a component editor for
TDatabaseSchema component. Context Database Designer comes as
part of Database Extensions Suite and is included into the
license price. 

Please, note that this is a *beta* version and you assume the 
entire risk of using these components in the commercial 
applications. We strongly advise all beta 1 users to upgrade 
to this beta 2 release as it fixes several severe problems 
introduced in beta 1. 

Important note to all users of beta 1!
======================================

Please uninstall beta 1 and backup your schema files (*.dsd, 
*.dbs and *.dfm forms, containing schema components) prior to
installing this suite. The format of database schema has changed
and, although we made every effort to ensure complete backward 
compatibility, it is important to backup and stay on the safe
side. After upgrading to this beta, open every schema your were
working with in the new Database Designer 2.02. You will notice 
that all the relations you defined are now converted into 
Relationships objects. As 1.7 and 2.01 weren't tracking the 
pairness the relations correctly you may notice that some of the
relationships doubled and some could be missing. Please open
properties dialog for each of the relationships objects and ensure
that all the fields and settings are correct. Remove duplicated 
relationships if necessary. 

If you were using version control and created checkpoints,
please run Compare Schemas (under Tools Menu) and ensure
that all the checkpoints are valid and the differences as
expected. If it is not crucial for your project, we advise
you to drop all checkpoints to avoid possible convertion
side-effects. If you find, that your schema is seriously
damaged, please e-mail it to us for investigation (see
e-mail below).

Context Database Extensions Suite is desinged to enhance
database related functionality provided by Borland Delphi
VCL library. It contains some generic imporvements as well
as the improvements pertaining to the specific
implementations of base VCL classes designed for
navigational database access. Context Database Extensions
now supports two types of database adapters: generic &
extended. Generic adapters provide basic database access
functionality, like transaction management, SQL query
execution or creating an instance of engine-specific
TDataSet descendant. We now support the following generic
adapters:

  - BDE (Borland Database Engine, see BDEExt.pas unit);
  - ADO (Access Data Objects, see ADOExt.pas unit);
  - DBX (DBExpress, see SQLExt.pas unit);
  - and IB (Interbase components, see IBExt.pas unit);

Extended adapters, beside basic functionality, also provide
client-side implementation of referential integrity (RI)
constraints, client-side triggers, change logging (used for
database replications), additional events and properties and
more. This functionality is being partially deprecated and
we slowely phasing it out as more and more databases begin
to support native server-side RI constraints, triggers,
stored procs and such. Currently, extended adapters are
provided for:

  - DBISAM Database Engine by Elevate Software (www.elevatesoft.com)
  - NexusDB by Nexus Database Systems Pty Ltd. (www.nexusdb.com)

For compatibility with different versions of database engines,
these adapters come in source code and located under DBISAM and NX
subfolders.

The main features, provided by Context Database Extensions are:

  - Persistent Database Schema. Database Schema contains the
  description of tables, relations between them as well as triggers,
  domains, views, stored procedures, generators/sequences
  and sql statements that should be executed to update a database to 
  the latest version required by the application. Database
  Schema may be stored within application, in the database
  (System tables) or as an external file.

  - Integrated Database Designer is registered as a component
  editor for TDatabaseSchema component. It gives access for 
  feature-rich diagramming tool right from Delphi IDE. 

  - Includes a number of usefull database components, like
  memory tables, enumerations and sequences.

  - Provides engine-specific highly customzable SQL generation 
  functionality via TDBEngineProfile component.

  - Provides classes for business logic incapsulation, like
  TDataSetReference, TDBDocument, TDBDocumentType & TDBJournal.
   

Extended adapters also provide the following additional functionality:

  - RI Constraints. Relations between tables, defined within
  database schema, allows to implement various types of referential
  integrity (RI) constrains (Error, Cascade and Nullify for delete
  & update operations). Please, note, that processing of RI
  constraints might sometimes considerably slow down some delete
  and update operations. 
  
  - Replications. All changes made to records can be automatically
  written into a separate table ('Objects' tables) and used for
  database replications. Replication & serialization functionality
  is encapsulated into TDBManager component, using TxxDatabaseExt
  components as database adapters.
  
  - Additional events and properties provided for database, table
  and query components (see ctxdbext.hlp for more details).


The day of the final release as well as the pricing will soon 
be announced. Everybody, who has purchased Context Database 
Extensions v.1 within past 3 month, will receive the upgrade 
free of charge. The owners of Context Database Extensions v.1
as well as the owners of other Context Software products 
will receive generous discounts.

Fully functional trial version (with part of source 
code included) is available at:
